# Pass Strength Guard

# Password Complexity Checker

A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords by analyzing various criteria such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It helps users create strong, secure passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack.

## How It Helps in Security

### Password Evaluation
The Password Complexity Checker assesses the strength of a password by checking if it meets specific complexity requirements. These requirements typically include a minimum length, the inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By ensuring that passwords meet these criteria, the tool helps users avoid common pitfalls like using easily guessable passwords or simple patterns.

### Enhanced Security
By encouraging the use of complex passwords, the Password Complexity Checker significantly enhances security. Strong passwords are less susceptible to brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other common password-cracking techniques. This added layer of security helps protect sensitive information and accounts from unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks.

## Steps for execution

### Install python on any linux based system like "Kali Linux".
### To install python on kali linux use command
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install python3 -y
### Open a text editor to create the script file. Use 'nano' or any other text editor available in Kali Linux
3. nano password_complexity_checker.py
### write Caesar Cipher program code in text editor.
### Save the file 
4. Press 'CTRL+O' to save.
5. Hit 'Enter' to confirm the file name.
6. Press 'CTRL+X' to exit the editor.
### Run the code/script
7. python3 password_complexity_checker.py
### Use the program
8. Enter any password of user choice
9. After entering password this tool checks its strength and gives strength of password like:
    Length of password (> 8 -> good length)
    Contains numbers included in password 
    Special Charcters included in password 
    Uppercase letters included in password 
    Lowercase letters included in password
10. Hence, Password strength is shown whether its weak, moderate, strong or very strong.
### This way Password Complexity Checker helps in providing security.
