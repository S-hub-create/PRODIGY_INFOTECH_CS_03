# Password Complexity Checker

A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords by analyzing various criteria such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It helps users create strong, secure passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack.

## How It Helps in Security

### Password Evaluation
The Password Complexity Checker assesses the strength of a password by checking if it meets specific complexity requirements. These requirements typically include a minimum length, the inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By ensuring that passwords meet these criteria, the tool helps users avoid common pitfalls like using easily guessable passwords or simple patterns.

### Enhanced Security
By encouraging the use of complex passwords, the Password Complexity Checker significantly enhances security. Strong passwords are less susceptible to brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other common password-cracking techniques. This added layer of security helps protect sensitive information and accounts from unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks.
